<br>
<p>In Salida we will go look around the downtown area. There is a fairly large art scene with several art galleries. We will go 
on Thursday evening after we have been skiing and just walk around seeing what there is to see. In Salida's Creative District there are over two dozen art 
galleries. So we shouldn't run out of options in terms of what to look at. There are also several gift shops and resteraunts near the Arkansas River that 
runs next to downtown.
